This is just a learn project. It is a playground project. As part of my learning of Riak I got very interested in consistent hashing. I did some more reading on it. Based on my understanding of those articles and of Riak, I created this implementation of consistent hashing which works like the consistent hashing mechanism in riak (at least that is what I think ;) ). This is written in Java (standard eclipse maven project).
